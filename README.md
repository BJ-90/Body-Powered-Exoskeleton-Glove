# Body Powered Exoskleton Glove

**Title:** A Soft, Body-Powered Exoskleton Glove for Grasping Capabilities Enhancement

**Description:** 
<p align="justify"> Soft, under-actuated and compliant robotic exo-gloves have received an increased interest over the last decade. Possible applications of these systems range from augmenting the capabilities of healthy individuals to restoring the mobility of people that suffer from paralysis or stroke. Despite the significant progress in the field, most existing solutions are still heavy and expensive, they require an external power source to operate, and they are not wearable.
In this project, we focus on the development of an adaptive (underactuated and compliant), tendon-driven, wearable exoskeleton glove and we propose a compact, affordable and lightweight assistive device that provides grasping capabilities enhancement to the user.  </p>
